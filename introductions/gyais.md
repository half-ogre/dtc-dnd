Gyais Whisperwind is a younger looking wood elf with cooper hued skin. He stands at 5'2" tall and weighs about 110 lbs. He has green eyes and black hair that hangs down to his shoulders. He wears a simple leather jerkin and carries a staff and a bow. He does not carry many other possesions and seems indifferent to others around him.

"My name is Gyais Whisperwind. Gundren was the first person I had interacted with in over 80 years. We met shortly after I left the forest looking for other druidic orders. I was hesitant of his intentions at first when he said he might be able to help me in finding someone who might point me in the right direction but after spending weeks travelling together he slowly gained my trust."

"My family and druidic order disappeared in my early years. Don't ask me how it happened for I do not even know. I was out in the forest alone communing with nature and only when I returned did I find that my order and family were gone. There was no trace or sign as to how this occurred. I searched through the woods but could not find a single trace of them anywhere. I spent many more years in the woods alone continuing to commune with nature and take comfort in the animals of the forest hoping they might return. This however never happened. It was when I finally struck out to find out what happened, seeking another drudic order that I stumbled across Gundren."
