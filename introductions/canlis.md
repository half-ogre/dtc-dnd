A dark haired rake sits in the middle of the table, laughing uproariously and telling jokes. 
His smile wide and inviting, charming - disarming and putting all around him at ease - but not quite reaching his twinkling green eyes. 
In the dim light of the corner where the company has gathered, you can't at a glance tell where his leathery skin ends and the well worn leather armor begins.
His ears are slightly pointed, picking him out as half-elven and his good looks are accented by a fine scar along his left cheek above a well kept short beard.
If one looks closely you notice he's tall and lanky but a little ... slight.

As the potboy brings a fresh round of drinks to the table, the charmer reaches up to the lad's ear and
pulls a shiny copper coin from fresh air and gifts it to the toiler. 

"Greetings my new friends, I'm Canlis son of Vesstan. I am happy to have fallen into the company of such friends of Gundren." He raises the wooden cup filled with
beer. "A hearty fellow. Gundren's an uncommonly forgiving dwarf. He even kept me as a friend when I, a down on his luck soul, lifted his purse when we first met...
once I had topped it off with the coins of a nasty merchant who had tried to rob us blind... ". 

Canlis roars with laughter, that leaps infectiously around the table, and nods to Gundren. "Firm friends."
