Valgim is a little rough around the edges. His face bears the wear of adventures and simple living. A slightly crooked nose and prominent jagged scar from right hairline to left eyebrow mark his face as less than pretty.

Valgim will soldier for whoever has the coin and the mead until he decides they do not deserve his time. 

He met Gundren on one of the many mercenary campaigns. Although they did not hit it off at first, Valgim and Gundren found mutual respect for each other in a minor dispute over the spoils of battle once they settled who owned the coin purse in question. How it was settled and what the outcome was is something that neither Valgim nor Gundren have shared the specifics about.
